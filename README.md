# Cliffside
Cliffside is a micro strategy game inspired by the Amiga hit Mega-lo-Mania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega-Lo-Mania). Grow your tribe, assign workers to work in buildings, produce goods and equip your army to defend your seaside settlement.

Cliffside was created for the [Game Off 2023](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023) game-jam.

### Disclaimer
While all code and design was done by me, almost all art assets used in Cliffside come from commercial asset packs I own. Those assets are not included in the GitHub repository.

### Controls:
* Left Mouse Button - select tiles, buildings or units.
* Right Mouse Button - order selected unit to move to the clicked tile or building.
* To send units out from a building where they work, select the building and then RMB on a tile or another building.
### How to play:
* Send your initial Workers to the Town Center to start spawning new Workers. 
* Build a Sawmill on a Forest tile and send Workers there to produce wood.
* Build a Smithy and assign Workers to create weapons (wood is required to produce weapons).
* Finally, build a Training Grounds to convert Workers into Warriors, using weapons.
### Hints:
- Production in buildings scales with number of Workers, but each consecutive Worker is less effective than the last. The same number of Workers will be more efficient when split across two or more buildings than when stuck in one building.
- When being attacked, you can order Workers out of a building to help defend. This will stop production, but will help you dispatch enemies more quickly, resulting in fewer losses.
